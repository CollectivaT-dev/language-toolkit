"You will usually want to deploy a language model in production. A good "
"language model will improve transcription accuracy by correcting "
"predictable spelling and grammatical mistakes. If you can predict what "
"kind of speech your üê∏STT will encounter, you can make great gains in "
"accuracy with a custom language model."

"For example, if you want to transcribe university lectures on biology, "
"you should train a language model on text related to biology. With this "
"biology-specific language model, üê∏STT will be able to better recognize "

"In this document we cover the role of technology, especially artificial "
"intelligence-based technology, on the preservation of endangered "
"languages. This is a living document that was created as part of the "

"carried out by Col·lectivaT and Sephardic Center of Istanbul (SKAD) "
"within the framework of the \"Grant Scheme for Common Cultural Heritage: "
"Preservation and Dialogue between Turkey and the EU–II (CCH-II)\" "

"There is currently a growing digital divide between languages with "
"sufficient resources and languages with fewer resources, further "
"exacerbating the danger of digital extinction for them. For the majority "
"languages, the process of generating useful tools and resources is much "
"easier due to their large web-presence. However, many minority languages "
"do not have sufficient material and human resources to power the creation"
" of such tools. Lack of state support, public visibility, societal and "
"institutional oppression are direct causes of these languages being "
"deprioritized in the digital spaces of today."

"Efforts on preservation of languages focus mainly on language "
"documentation, teaching, and physical community building. One area that "
"is overlooked is creation of tools based on artificial intelligence. "
"Tools like machine translation, speech synthesis, and speech recognition "
"are now important counterparts in creating human-machine interfaces. "
"Also, these tools can help model the knowledge of dying languages and "
"store them for future generations."

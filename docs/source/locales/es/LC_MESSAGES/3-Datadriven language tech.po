"Machine Translation (MT) is defined as the automatic conversion of a "

"phrases between translations. These probabilities are learned in a "

" producing and correcting translations can be performed by speakers of "
"the language without depending on the intervention of outside linguists. "

"existence of morphological, syntactic, and semantic analyses of the "

"Text-to-speech (or speech synthesis) involves production of a human-like "
"speech given a text input with a computer. Before the advent of deep "
"learning, there were two main approaches to text-to-speech (TTS) "
"synthesis: concatenative TTS, and parametric TTS. Concatenative TTS, also"
" called unit selection, combines short pre-recorded audio clips called "
"units to synthesise the desired text. Concatenative TTS can provide a "
"good performance in terms of speech quality but the cut and stitch "
"procedure means a lack of naturalness. Parametric TTS relies on "
"statistical methods by generating speech with a combination of parameters"
" like F0 and energy, modelling the human speech production."

"within the framework of the \"Grant Scheme for Common Cultural Heritage: "

msgid ""
"There is currently a growing digital divide between languages with "
"sufficient resources and languages with fewer resources, further "
"exacerbating the danger of digital extinction for them. For the majority "
"languages, the process of generating useful tools and resources is much "
"easier due to their large web-presence. However, many minority languages "
"do not have sufficient material and human resources to power the "
"creation of such tools. Lack of state support, public visibility, "
"societal and institutional oppression are direct causes of these "
"languages being deprioritized in the digital spaces of today."

"Efforts on preservation of languages focus mainly on language "
"documentation, teaching, physical community building. One area that is "
"overlooked is creation of tools based on artificial intelligence. Tools "
"like machine translation, speech synthesis, speech recognition are now "
"important counterparts in creating human-machine interfaces. Also, these "
"tools can help model the knowledge of dying languages and store them for "
"future generations."

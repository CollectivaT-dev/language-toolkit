"In linguistics, a corpus (plural corpora) or text corpus is a language "
"resource consisting of a large and structured set of texts in a language "
"in digital format. They are useful in corpus linguistics for doing "
"statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, checking occurrences or "
"validating linguistic rules within a specific language territory. For "
"language technology, they are an essential part in creating statistical "
"language models that are used in applications such as optical character "
"recognition, handwriting recognition, machine translation, spelling "
"correction, assisted writing."

"The type of data that is needed to build a machine translation system is "
"parallel data, which consists of a collection of sentences in a language "

"In order to train machine translation models it is not enough just to "

"resulting documents either have to correspond line by line or contain the"
" original sentences and their translations in the same line. `Hunalign "
"<https://github.com/danielvarga/hunalign>`_ helps in creating sentence "

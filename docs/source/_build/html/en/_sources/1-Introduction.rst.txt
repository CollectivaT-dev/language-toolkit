Introduction
============

.. In this document we cover the role of technology, especially artificial intelligence-based technology, on the preservation of endangered languages. This is a living document that was created as part of the project "Judeo-Spanish: Connecting the two ends of the Mediterranean" carried out by Col·lectivaT and Sephardic Center of Istanbul (SKAD) within the framework of the "Grant Scheme for Common Cultural Heritage: Preservation and Dialogue between Turkey and the EU–II (CCH-II)" implemented by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Turkey with the financial support of the European Union.

.. The motivation
.. --------------

There is currently a growing digital divide between languages with sufficient resources and languages with fewer resources, further exacerbating the danger of digital extinction for them. For the majority languages, the process of generating useful tools and resources is much easier due to their large web-presence. However, many minority languages do not have sufficient material and human resources to power the creation of such tools. Lack of state support, public visibility, societal and institutional oppression are direct causes of these languages being deprioritized in the digital spaces of today.

Efforts on preservation of languages focus mainly on language documentation, teaching, and physical community building. One area that is overlooked is creation of tools based on artificial intelligence. Tools like machine translation, speech synthesis, and speech recognition are now important counterparts in creating human-machine interfaces. Also, these tools can help model the knowledge of dying languages and preserve them for future generations.

Who is this document for?

This document is for you if you are:

- *Language activist* who's interested in extending tools and resources in their language 
- *Linguist* who is interested in collecting data for research and building language technology
- *Natural language processing (NLP) researcher* who is interested in augmenting data for their language of interest
- *Language activist allies* who want to support the revitalization of under-resourced languages

Languages and the digital age
=============================

Digital age has brought many new opportunities and advantages. It has undoubtedly connected the humankind in unimaginable ways in a short amount of time. Although, no innovation comes with its challenges and threats. World wide web is a resource accessible (almost) to all but it is dominated by a handful of power languages. 

English for example is spoken by 15% of the world but it currently holds 54% of all the content in the web. On the other hand, languages like Russian, Chinese, Spanish each represent around %5-6 of the content in web, in spite of their geopolitical dominance. 

Where does this leave world's many endangered and dying languages? Sadly, on the very margins of this picture. 

Languages thrive in communities and passed onto generations with day-to-day usage. The more our lives are connected through digital mediums, we are less and less exposed to our mothertongues which are not represented online. This eventually leads to a decline of their usage by younger generations. 

.. note::

	How? To illustrate, a Kurdish speaker in Turkey, accesses their government health services website and sees that everything is in Turkish, or goes to check the latest online social media platform and sees that it's by default available in English. These kind of small encounters lead to thinking that in order to find their way and address their needs, speaking their mothertongue is not enough. You have to know the nearest majority language and many times even more.

Digital extinction
------------------

According to UNESCO, around 3,500 languages are expected to be extinct by the end of this century and we cannot deny the role of technology in this. 

We shouldn't of course fall into the trap of making technology the culprit of language loss. It is merely a representation of already existing power dynamics in the society. States which depriotize or even oppress certain languages start their digital transformation by excluding all these languages in their digital infrastructure. North American and Eurocentric big technology companies follow a English-first approach by default.

Although internet and technology can come to the rescue as well. Instead of a defranchising, technology can be rethought to form communities around language preservation, knowledge sharing, language documentation. 

Online presence of a language
-----------------------------

Traditionally, the responsabilities of a language activist has been actively speaking the language, passing it to younger generations, forming language learning and speaking communities, negotiating with public institutions for the inclusion of their language, collaborating with linguists for the documentation of their language and so on. 

Nowadays, the challenge is not just making the language alive in the physical world but also online. It is related in three ways for the survival of a language:

1. Exchanges and visibility online strikes interest and helps engage existing and new language learners.
2. What's stored online in turn is a digital record for language which helps documentation and technology development. 

Below, we will describe some ways internet is becoming multilingual and plural while helping reviving them. 

Access to knowledge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most popular initiatives on bringing languages online is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is open an online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers through an open collaboration and reviewing system. 

Wikipedia's broad aim is to democratize access to knowledge. Naturally, the culture built around this ethos goes hand in hand with multilinguality. Although it has started only with English, it quickly expanded to world's many languages. 

.. note::

	The first edit on a non-English Wikipedia was made in Catalan on March 16, 2001. Today, it is most notable for its large number of quality articles (20th largest wikipedia), which illustrates Catalan language's important online presence despite being a minority language. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_Wikipedia)

We can probably say that it's the most language diverse platform on the internet with 326 languages (as of 03.05.22) and counting up. For the latest list of wikipedias: https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias

<<<<IMAGE OF LANGUAGES OF WIKIPEDIA>>>>>

Making a new language available in Wikipedia is no easy task (see https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:How_to_start_a_new_Wikipedia), but it is definitely a great way to make knowledge accessible online and build a virtual community around it.

Immersion into language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One great example of a language reviving with the help of technology is Yiddish. The number of Yiddish speakers decreased drastically from around 10 million speakers due to the Holocaust. Whoever survived were forced to assimilate the language of their new lands to avoid persecution. In the last century, the use of Yiddish had almost disappeared except for small and disperse Hasidic communities.

With the rise of internet and popularity of online forums, Yiddish speakers used these platforms to converse in their language. Over time, the virtual world became the primary meeting point for Yiddish speakers in forums like The Idishe Velt (The Jewish World) and Kave Shtiebel (The Coffee House). 

Language documentation projects
-------------------------------

The rapid loss of languages in the last century has powered many initiatives for language documentation and revitalization. One of these initiatives is The Endangered Languages Project (https://www.endangeredlanguages.com/) which is a web-based platform that acts as a collaborative hub of language enthusiasts, linguists and industry partners to help strengthen endangered languages. Users of the website act as contributors by uploading language samples in text, audio, link or video format using a unique geotagging system that allows for easy searchability.

Similarly, Wikitongues (https://wikitongues.org/), which started in 2014, collects recordings and resources of world's languages. Currently it holds videos in over 700 languages, lexicons in 200 languages and links to hundreds of external resources.

"Traditional" technology
------------------------

Saving a language isnâ€™t just a matter of recording words or phrases and digitising them to be held in an online vault. Language is inherently about people, culture and identity. In order to keep a language alive, it needs to be spoken by many, immersed in everyday culture and actively passed on to future generations. These days, internet, social media, software, platforms occupy a large space in our everyday lives. In this section, we will list some of the core tools needed for a technology to thrive digitally.

Unicode-supported font
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A digital font is the way computers know how to display the characters in your language. Unicode, formally the Unicode Standard, is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. The standard, which is maintained by the Unicode Consortium, defines 144,697 characters covering 159 modern and historic scripts, as well as symbols, emoji, and non-visual control and formatting codes. (Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).

You can check if your language is supported by a font by going to Google Noto (https://fonts.google.com/noto/) and searching among fonts that represent more than 500 writing systems. If it is not there, you can create your own with the help from a font designer and install it manually on your computer.

Keyboard
~~~~~~~~

Until the day we will be speaking naturally with computers, the most basic interface for interacting with them will be the keyboard. It is a technology easily taken for granted for world's many languages but unfortunately it is not available in all of world's writing systems. If a keyboard is not present or not developed enough for a language, its speakers tend to prefer other alphabets or even languages to communicate. For example, speakers of Ethiopian languages like Amharic, Tigrinya and Oromo switch to using English as Ge'ez script is not pre-installed in their smartphones. Young arabic speakers in many countries have invented their own chat-alphabet Arabizi(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_chat_alphabet) consisting of latin characters and numerals to account for the lack of Arabic script support in early mobile and web technology.

If a keyboard is not available, let's say in your phone or computer, here's some resources to search or help create your own keyboard: 

- Google's mobile keyboard, Gboard (https://support.google.com/gboard/answer/6380730?hl=en&ref_topic=9023832&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=0) 
- Keyman supports 2000 languages (https://keyman.com/)
- Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=102134)
- Ukelele is a Unicode Keyboard Layout Editor for the macOS (https://software.sil.org/ukelele/)


Online dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A dictionary (lexicon) is a solid way of documenting a language since it acts as a reference of words and their meanings. An online dictionary never goes out-of-print as it is accessible from any device with an internet connection. Also, open-source dictionaries can live and grow collaboratively as a community effort involving both speakers of the language, linguists and technologists. 

Living Dictionaries (https://livingdictionaries.app/) is an online dictionary-builder platform created by Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. It provides comprehensive, free online tech tools that assist language communities in conservation and revitalization efforts. It also allows recording of words and phrases. As of May 2022, it support 237 languages. To initiate your language in Living Dictionaries, you can get use of their "Elicitation lists" (https://livingtongues.org/the-master-elicitation-list/) and watch tutorials their YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiYtwIJ6yAgO2_IeLMgrirA).

Data-driven language technologies
---------------------------------

The digital revolution is here with us and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key technological enabler as it offers a range of new opportunities to break down existing barriers to human development and social inclusion.

Toolkit for minority/low-resource languages
===========================================

In this document we cover the role of technology, especially artificial intelligence-based technology, on the preservation of endangered languages. This is a living document that was created as part of the project "Judeo-Spanish: Connecting the two ends of the Mediterranean" carried out by Col·lectivaT and Sephardic Center of Istanbul (SKAD) within the framework of the "Grant Scheme for Common Cultural Heritage: Preservation and Dialogue between Turkey and the EU–II (CCH-II)" implemented by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Turkey with the financial support of the European Union.
